# Crypto-Analysis

I analyze cryptocurrencies using time series techniques. Most of the notebooks use only Bitcoin, but this can be swapped out for any other cryptocurrency. I recreate many of the charts as seen [here](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/). 

I also do forecasting using ARIMA. Due to the volatility and high fluctuations of Bitcoin, I considered using the logaritham of the price of Bitcoin. Then I forecasted this log price.
